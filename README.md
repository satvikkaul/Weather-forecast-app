# Weather Forecast App

A weather dashboard built with React. Enter a city to view the current
conditions and a short forecast powered by the OpenWeather API.
## Getting Started

1. Open `static/app.jsx` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your OpenWeather API key.
2. Open `static/index.html` in your browser. The app uses CDN links for React so no build step is required.

## Features
- Search for a city's current weather
- Displays temperature, description, humidity and wind speed
- Shows a 3-day forecast with icons
- Includes loading indicators and improved error handling

The app requires a free API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api).
